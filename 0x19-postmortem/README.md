Issue Summary:
	Duration:
 		Start Time: February 10, 2024, 15:00 UTC
   		End Time: February 11, 2024, 04:30 UTC
	Impact:
 		The messaging services was completely inaccessible for all users, affecting 100% of our user base.
	Root Cause:
		A misconfigured emoji rendering module caused a cascade failure in our message processing pipeline.
Timeline:
	February 10, 2024, 15:00 UTC:
 		Issue was detected as users flooded customer support with complaints about messages not being sent.
   	15:30 UTC:
		Engineering team initiated investigation, focusing on recent changes to the messaging service.
  	17:00 UTC:
   		Database team rolled back recent changes, but issue ppersisted.
		DevOps team investigated network configurations, finding no abnormalities.
  	20:00 UTC:
   		Suspicion shifted to application code, leading to extensive code review sessions.
	 	Debugging focused on message encoding and serialization.
   	February 11, 2024, 01:00 UTC:
		Incident escalated to senior engineers and management due to prolonged downtime.
  		Cross-team collaboration intensified to to identify the root cause.
	04:30 UTC:
 		Root cause identified as a misconfigurations in the emoji rendering module.
   		Immediate fix deployed to restore service functionality.
Root Cause and Resolution:
	Root Cause:
 		A recent update to the emoji rendering module introduced a configuration error, causing messages with emojis to trigger infinite loops in the processing pipeline.
	Resolutions:
 		Engineers reconfigured the emoji rendering module to limit recursion depth, preventing further cascade failures.
   		Additional monitoring implemented to detect similar misconfigurations.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
	Improvements/Fixes:
 		Implement stricter code review processes for configuration changes.
   		Enhance testing procedures to include edge cases related to message processing.
	 	Develop automated checks for detecting abnormal processing patterns.
   	Tasks:
		Conduct thorough post-incident analysis to identify any lingering issues or potential vulnerabilities.
  		Schedule regular review sessions to ensure all system configurations adhere to best practices.
		Implement a rollback mechanism for configuration changes to quickly revert to stable configurations in emergencies.
The great Emoji outage of 2024 serves as a reminder that even the smallest misconfigurations can have significant impacts on service availablity.By implementing robust testing, monitoring and review processes, we can prevent similar incidents in the future and keep emojis flowing smoothly. Lets learn from this experience and emoji on!ðŸ˜„ðŸš€
